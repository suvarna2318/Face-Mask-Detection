# Face-Mask-Detection
Face mask detection system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to classify people as wearing or not wearing a mask, with real-time detection support.

#  Face Mask Detection using CNN

## Project Overview
With the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic, wearing a mask became essential for public health.  
This project uses **Deep Learning (CNNs)** to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not from images.

---

##  Objective
- Detect if a person is **with mask** üò∑ or **without mask** ‚ùå  
- Build a **real-time detection system** using Computer Vision.

---

##  Tech Stack
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib  

---

##  Dataset
- **Dataset**: [Face Mask Detection Dataset]  
- **Classes**:  
  - `with_mask`  
  - `without_mask`  

---

## ‚öô Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Image resizing, normalization, augmentation.  
2. **Model Building**
   - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture.  
   - Training with categorical crossentropy loss.  
3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.  
   - Confusion Matrix.  
4. **Deployment**
   - Real-time mask detection using webcam feed (OpenCV).  

---

##  Results
- Achieved **~XX% accuracy** on test data.  
- Successfully detected faces with and without masks in real-time.  

---

## üöÄ Future Improvements
- Improve accuracy with Transfer Learning (MobileNetV2, ResNet50).  
- Deploy as a **web app** (Flask/Streamlit).  
- Extend to detect **improper mask usage**.
